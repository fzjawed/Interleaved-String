# Interleaved-String

I am weeping I wanted to use this as my streak question but I submitted it too early so now it won't count. 🕳️ she dumb

WHY DOESNT PITBULL MAKE MUSIC ANYMORE UM????? BYE?

***Question: Given two strings s0 and s1, return the two strings interleaved, starting with s0. If there are leftover characters in a string they should be added to the end.****

Haha I still dunno how this question works 💆 I just learned cool new things so I'm happy. This ``zip()`` thing I've seen being used by some people to solve questions but I was always a little too intimidated to read up about it. 

Anywho what ``zip`` does is take one or more iterable (as an argument; these can be lists, tuples, strings) and construct an ``iterator`` of tuples where each tuple contains elements from each iterable.

``The purpose of zip() is to map the similar index of multiple containers so that they can be used just using as single entity. ``

***NOTE: zip() returns an iterator object - if you print it you'll see something weird 🤠 Print out with an iterable***

So we're making a ``result`` list and **extend()** each tuple in the zip() to this result list.
